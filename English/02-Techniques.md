# 🛠️ Prompt Engineering

**Prompt Engineering** is the science of designing effective prompts to get the best possible responses from language models.  
A well-crafted prompt can dramatically improve the quality of the AI's output! ✨🤖

💡 The term *"prompt"* is already familiar in tech — like the Windows *Command Prompt*, where you input commands (input) and the system responds with actions (output).

➡️ With language models, it works similarly: you write an input with a clear intention, and the model responds accordingly.

# 🎯 Key Techniques

1. ✅ **Be clear with instructions**  
   Give context for the kind of output you expect.

2. 🧩 **Break down complex tasks**  
   Split large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.

3. 🧠 **Ask for justification**  
   Request that the model explains its reasoning.

4. 🔁 **Generate multiple outputs**  
   Ask for variations and then request improvements or combinations.

5. 📝 **Provide examples or describe the expected output**  
   Helps align the model with your intended outcome.

# ✍️ Few-Shot Prompting

**Few-shot prompting** is when you provide **two or more examples** to the model before giving the main task, so it learns the desired pattern and style.

📚 Types of prompting:
- ❌ **Zero-shot**: just the instruction, no examples.
- ☝️ **One-shot**: one example before the main task.
- ✌️ **Few-shot**: two or more examples plus the instruction.

# 💬 Sentiment Analysis

Let’s imagine a scenario where we want to perform **sentiment analysis** on Instagram comments about a movie or a TV show 🎬📱

Comments like:
- "This movie was **amazing**!" → **Positive** ✅  
- "I thought it was **terrible**..." → **Negative** ❌

⚙️ The goal is to classify each comment based on the **emotion or opinion** it expresses — something that can be automated using good prompts and well-trained language models.
